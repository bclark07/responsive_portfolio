                    Hello! My name is Brittany Clark and I am thrilled to be learning about computer programming. I tend
                    to be interested in a lot of different things and enjoy taking classes to learn more about my
                    interests. In the past few years I have taken sewing, Spanish, and a Yoga Teacher Training course. I
                    have been interested in computer science since college when I signed up for an introductory computer
                    science class as a requirement for my degree (after the alternative class - logic - kept filling
                    up). I ended up loving it, but ultimately decided not to pursue it after I graduated. Now, 12 years
                    later, I have returned to the classroom to learn about programming (and how much it has changed).
                </p>
                <p> Currently, I work as a Client Success Manager at Dude Solutions in Cary, NC. I completed my
                    undergraduate degree at Wellesley College where I studied Cognitive Science with a concentration in
                    Computer Science. Since graduating college I worked at 2 different summer camps (one for students
                    with learning disabilities), participated in Americorps in New Orleans, worked at a Psychiatric
                    Residential Treatment Facility, and then returned to graduate school where I earned a dual Masters
                    degree in Social Work and Public Adminitration. Afterward I worked for a Managed Care Organization
                    which helps administer Medicaid funds for people with Mental Health diagnoses, and then a year ago,
                    I transitioned to the private sector and started at Dude Solutions. </p>
                <p>I consider myself to be a very extroverted person and love meeting new people and learning about
                    their lives. I also enjoy being outside and hiking. Both of the summer camps I worked at had an
                    emphasis on wilderness exploration and camping. I hope that the new skills I learn in this course
                    will help me to have a positive impact on the lives of others. </p>
